# 🚀 EveryCity API — Laravel 12 Backend for Events, Membership & Missional Operations

The **EveryCity API** is a modern, scalable Laravel 12 backend designed to power the EveryCity Movement — a multi-expressional Christian mission focused on prayer, discipleship, and citywide transformation. Built with industry-standard architecture and secure authentication, this API serves as the foundation for managing events, memberships, prayer submissions, and operational workflows across cities and campuses.

Crafted with a clean, modular structure, the API supports token-based authentication, advanced role-based access control, and full CRUD operations for event and membership management. Event statuses (upcoming, current, past) are automatically calculated using an intelligent observer system, ensuring accuracy without manual intervention. The project also includes auto-generated API documentation through Scramble, giving developers a seamless, interactive interface for understanding and testing endpoints.

With an emphasis on stability, clarity, and scalability, the EveryCity API provides a robust backend platform tailored for missions, intercessory networks, discipleship communities, and large-scale event coordination — enabling teams to build powerful front-end applications and administrative systems on top of a solid Laravel ecosystem.
